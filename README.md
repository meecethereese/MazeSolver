Problem Description

A gaming company YAMCO created a game called Mind the App where players solve puzzles to advance
to the next level. Part of the game called BACMAN is designed for players to complete a maze in
record time. Some designers are struggling to create multiple variants of the maze. Some mazes are
unsolvable while others are too easy. The chief of designers has assigned you to create a solution
in JavaScript which can take or generate any maze to tell if it is solvable.

Task

Use your JavaScript knowledge to create a solution that tells if a given maze is, or is not
solvable. This way, the chief of designers can prevent her team from wasting their time on failed
mazes.
